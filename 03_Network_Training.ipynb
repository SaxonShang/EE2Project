Optimizers define the specific method used to update in each timestep the weights of the network. For example, the vanilla Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) only uses the gradient of the weight with respect to the loss in the current timestep $t$, along with the learning rate, to update the weights. However, other optimizers use more sophisticate methods (e.g., keeping track of past gradient updates to use as momentum) to compute the weights' updates.\n",

A nice visualization of such behavior is the following animation, where you can notice some methods, i.e., Adadelta (yellow), and Rmsprop (black) converge significantly faster than SGD (red), which gets stuck in a local minimum.\n",

As a rule of thumb, Adam is usually easier to tune due to the adaptive learning rate, whereas SGD with momentum [has been shown](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.07628.pdf) to reach better results when tuned correctly.\n",

        "Neural Networks have a large number of weights that need to be initialized properly. Weight initialization is a crucial step in tuning neural networks as different initial values can lead the model to reach different local minima. If your initial weights are too small, the network may have problems learning due to small/vanishing gradients. However, if they are too large, you may run into exploding gradients or you could saturate an activation in the network (e.g. a sigmoid). Hence, we need a proper initialization with not too large nor not too small weights. In [this link](https://www.deeplearning.ai/ai-notes/initialization/) you can find an explanation of the importance of weight initialization.  The weights are usually randomly initialized by different algorithms, e.g. Xavier, He_normal or LeCun, all of them theoretically motivated to have specific properties following different assumptions.\n",

For instance, in the function `Dense()`, which defines the mapping $y= Ax + b$, you can initialize the kernel values ($A$ in the equation) with a normal distribution (by default the `stddev` is 0.05) and the bias ($b$ in the equation) with $0$ using the code below."

EarlyStopping monitors a metric (e.g. `val_categorical_accuracy`) and after a few epochs where that metric has not improved (`patience` variable) the training process stops.

In the following example we can see how using `preprocessing.Normalization()` makes our data have `mean=0` and `standard_deviation=1`. Contrary to the other transformations we showed, before normalizing the data we need to use `adapt(train_data)` to compute the mean and standard deviation of the whole training set. The mean and standard deviation computed will then be saved and applied to standardize the individual images."
